Section 4: Charts and APIs

Your team decided to design a dashboard to display the statistic of COVID19 cases. You are tasked to display one of the components of the dashboard which is to display a visualisation representation of number of COVID19 cases in Singapore over time.

Your team decided to use the public data from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#b07f97ba-24f4-4ebe-ad71-97fa35f3b683.

Display a graph to show the number cases in Singapore over time using the APIs from https://covid19api.com/.


# Solution Design
